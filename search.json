    "text": "Introduction\nMy final project datasets include the “classics” dataset from corgis, and various books written by Jane Austen from Project Gutenberg. I am motivated to conduct analysis about Jane Austen because she was one of the greatest female novelists in the 18th century. Her works always express a well-articulated crique and reflection about romance, marriage, wealth, and society, which led me to ask the question: what is the unique writing style or characteristic of Jane Austen? To answer this question, I will be using data from the following sources: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/classics/ https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31100\n\n\nExploring the Data\nThe classics dataset includes data about 1006 books from the work of 555 authors. For each book, the dataset provides general information such as publication year and classification, also word analysis information such as number of sentences or reading difficulty level scores. Some potential flaws in the data are overlapping information and missing/misleading publication year. The book “Pride and Prejudice”, for example, have two versions that is one updated and another older. Publication year may also be misleading as the year may reflect a more recent, edited publication of the book rather than the original publication year. Data cleaning is required before substantive analysis is conducted.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndataset = \"classics.csv\"\n\nclassic_data = pd.read_csv('classics.csv')\nclassic_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbibliography.congress classifications\nbibliography.languages\nbibliography.subjects\nbibliography.title\nbibliography.type\nmetadata.downloads\nmetadata.id\nmetadata.rank\nmetadata.url\nbibliography.author.birth\n...\nmetrics.sentiments.polarity\nmetrics.sentiments.subjectivity\nmetrics.statistics.average letter per word\nmetrics.statistics.average sentence length\nmetrics.statistics.average sentence per word\nmetrics.statistics.characters\nmetrics.statistics.polysyllables\nmetrics.statistics.sentences\nmetrics.statistics.syllables\nmetrics.statistics.words\n\n\n\n\n0\nPR\nen\nSisters -- Fiction,Courtship -- Fiction,Social...\nPride and Prejudice\nText\n36576\n1342\n1\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342\n1775\n...\n0.136713\n0.522239\n4.83\n18\n0.05\n586794\n4603\n6511\n170648.1\n121533\n\n\n1\nPS\nen\nMentally ill women -- Fiction,Feminist fiction...\nThe Yellow Wallpaper\nText\n26363\n1952\n2\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952\n1860\n...\n0.054174\n0.534787\n4.41\n15\n0.06\n26769\n102\n385\n7686.9\n6067\n\n\n2\nPZ,PR\nen\nFantasy\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland\nText\n18882\n11\n3\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11\n1832\n...\n0.041079\n0.497276\n4.65\n17\n0.06\n122719\n339\n1501\n33810.3\n26389\n\n\n3\nPR\nen\nMonsters -- Fiction;Frankenstein's monster (Fi...\nFrankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus\nText\n17128\n84\n4\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84\n1797\n...\n0.100902\n0.539516\n4.77\n23\n0.04\n357604\n2604\n3239\n106802.1\n74959\n\n\n4\nPT\nen\nPsychological fiction,Metamorphosis -- Fiction\nMetamorphosis\nText\n15683\n5200\n5\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5200\n1883\n...\n0.041997\n0.479019\n4.56\n27\n0.04\n100372\n397\n800\n28752.3\n22022\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 38 columns\n\n\n\n\nnum_books = classic_data['bibliography.title'].count()\nprint(num_books)\n\n1006\n\n\n\nnum_authors = classic_data['bibliography.author.name'].nunique()\nprint(num_authors)\n\n555\n\n\n\njane_data = classic_data[classic_data['bibliography.author.name'] == \"Austen, Jane\"]\n\n\n# Data Visualization 1\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nauthor_birth_year = classic_data['bibliography.author.birth']\nfiltered_data = classic_data[author_birth_year.between(1700, 1799)]\nauthor_name = filtered_data['bibliography.author.name']\nreadability_score = filtered_data['metrics.difficulty.flesch reading ease']\n\nplt.bar(author_name, readability_score)\nplt.xlabel(\"Author Name\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Flesch Reading Ease Score\")\nplt.title(\"Reading Difficulty Levels of Classic Literature in 18th Century\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right', fontsize=5)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nComment: Jane Austen’s work has an average flesch reading score of about 70, which is a fairly easy to read level (7th grade material according to official flesch reading ease website).\n\n# Data Visualization 2\n\nbook_title = jane_data['bibliography.title']\ntitle_to_exclude = 'The Complete Project Gutenberg Works of Jane Austen: A Linked Index of all PG Editions of Jane Austen'\nfiltered_book_title = book_title[~(book_title == title_to_exclude)]\nnum_words = jane_data['metrics.statistics.words']\nfiltered_num_words = jane_data.loc[~(book_title == title_to_exclude), 'metrics.statistics.words']\n\nplt.bar(filtered_book_title, filtered_num_words)\nplt.title(\"Total Word Count in Jane Austen's Works\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Book Title\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Words\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nComment: Jane Austen writes both short and long novels.\n\n# Data Visualization 3\n\nnum_words = jane_data['metrics.statistics.words']\nreadability = jane_data['metrics.difficulty.difficult words']\n\nplt.plot(num_words, readability)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Data Visualization 4\n\nauthor_book_count = classic_data.groupby('bibliography.author.name')['bibliography.title'].count()\n\nplt.hist(author_book_count)\nplt.xlabel('Number of Books Written by Author')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Distribution of Book Publication Frequency by Each Author')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nComment: Jane Austen had 8 publications, which is substantially more compared to other classics authors. What are potential factors for this? Her career as a novelist? More talent? Personal life? Time period?

I would write a function that retrieves each books’ text file from the website, then split each text into string according to chapters. The end result would be 8 strings with eacch string item being one chapter of that particular book.\n\nimport requests\n\ntarget_url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt\"\nresponse = requests.get(target_url)\npp_string = response.text\npp_string = pp_string.split('***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE***')[1]\npp_string = pp_string.split('***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE***')[0]\npp_chapters = [i.lower() for i in pp_string.split('CHAPTER')[1:]]\n\n\nprint(pp_chapters[0])\n\n i.\n\n\nit is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n\nhowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\n\n\"my dear mr. bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\nnetherfield park is let at last?\"\n\nmr. bennet replied that he had not.\n\n\"but it is,\" returned she; \"for mrs. long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.\"\n\nmr. bennet made no answer.\n\n\"do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\n\n\"_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.\"\n\nthis was invitation enough.\n\n\"why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came\ndown on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.\"\n\n\"what is his name?\"\n\n\"bingley.\"\n\n\"is he married or single?\"\n\n\"oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four\nor five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\n\"how so? how can it affect them?\"\n\n\"my dear mr. bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! you\nmust know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\n\"is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\n\"i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.\"\n\n\"my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\ni do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. when a woman has\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\n\"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"it is more than i engage for, i assure you.\"\n\n\"but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\ncomers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\n\"you are over scrupulous surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\ni must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.\"\n\n\"i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as lydia. but you are always giving _her_ the\npreference.\"\n\n\"they have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\n\"mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take\ndelight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\n\"you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they\nare my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\n\"ah! you do not know what i suffer.\"\n\n\"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.\"\n\n\"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them\nall.\"\n\nmr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. she was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented she\nfancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Data visualization 1 --&gt; Overall Sentiment\n\n# Compute the overall polarity score of positive and negative words in each book\n# Combine into one visualization\n\n\n# Data visualization 2 --&gt; Sentiment Development\n\n# Compute development of sentiment in each book\n# Combine into one visualization\n\n\n# Data visualization 3 --&gt; Character Analysis\n\n# Create a graph of character interactions and relationships\n# then use networkx and matplotlib to visualizae the network\n\n\n# Data visualization 4 --&gt; Important Sentences\n\n# Use techniques of automatic bulletting\n# Generate a list of important sentences from each book\n# then visualize using stacked bar chart for what percentage is positive or negative"

I plan to conduct three types of data visualizations: overall sentiment, sentiment development, and network analysis.

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\n# Import packages\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\nfrom nltk.sentiment import vader\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.corpus import opinion_lexicon\nfrom nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\nfrom string import punctuation\nimport networkx as nx\n\nBelow is my first data exploration graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar plot shows that Jane Austen’s work has an average flesch reading score of about 70, which is a fairly easy reading level (7th grade material according to official flesch reading ease website) in comparison to other authors in the same time period. An easy to read level may suggest that Jane intends for her writing to be popularly circulated, so she writes in an easier, less difficult language to attract a public audience.\nBelow is my second data exploration graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram show the number of books written per author. The most frequent number of books written per lifetime of a classic literature author is between 0 to 5. Jane Austen had 8 publications, which is substantially more compared to other classics authors. What are potential contributing factors for this? Her career as a novelist, talent, family background, time period could all be contriubting factors. These external factors would contribute to the writing style that Jane Austen would adopt, as frequent publications meant the author enjoys public-facing or needs income.\nBelow is my third data exploration graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar plot shows that the average sentiment/polarity score of Jane Austen’s works range from 0.12 to 0.16. This is an overall positive score, which means that Jane Austen generally adopt a positive tone in her writings. It is not surprising to discover this, becaus the book titles are already showing abundance positivity using words like “love”, “sense”, etc. This finding would be further explored in the next section through the analysis of sentiment development in each book.\nBelow is my fourth data exploration graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot shows the sentiment score of Austen’s works ordered by publication year (since the original data had misleading publication years, I created a new list of first publication years based on my research from the Internet). We can see a sentiment score increase as Jane publishes more books, but then the sentiment score decreases in her most recent work. We can also see that there is a gap in the graph, for which Jane’s peak years were 1810s to 1820s, then she did not publish anything until 50 years later in the 1870s. Jane’s personal lifetime could have contributed to her fluctuating choice of words in her works, which will be further explore in the analysis section.\nFor my analysis, I plan to webscrape the Project Gutenberg’s complete collection of works by Jane Austen. I would use the requests package to retrieve each books’ text file from the website, then split each text into string according to chapters. The end result would be 8 strings with eacch string item being one chapter of that particular book.\n\n# Create a function to webscrape text files from Project Gutenberg\ndef scrape_txt(target_url):\n    response = requests.get(target_url)\n    parse = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    download_link = None\n    for link in parse.find_all('a'):\n        if 'Plain Text UTF-8' in link.get_text():\n            download_link = link['href']\n            break\n\n    if download_link:\n        txt_url = f\"https://www.gutenberg.org/{download_link}\"\n        response = requests.get(txt_url)\n        txt_content = response.text\n        return txt_content\n    else:\n        return None\n\n\n# Create a string of all Jane Austen's work, each item is one book\njane_austen = []\n\nfor url in jane_data['metadata.url']:\n    content = scrape_txt(url)\n    if content is not None:\n        jane_austen.append(content)\n\nbook_title = jane_data['bibliography.title']\njane_austen_work = dict(zip(book_title, jane_austen))\njane_austen_work = dict(list(jane_austen_work.items())[:8])\n\n\n# splitting each book into chapters, all accessible in the dictionary \"chapters\"\nchapters = {}\ntitles = {\n    'Emma': 'EMMA',\n    'Persuasion': 'PERSUASION',\n    'Northanger Abbey': 'NORTHANGER ABBEY',\n    'Mansfield Park': 'MANSFIELD PARK',\n    'Pride and Prejudice': 'PRIDE AND PREJUDICE',\n    'Love and Freindship [sic]': 'LOVE AND FREINDSHIP [SIC]',\n    'Sense and Sensibility': 'SENSE AND SENSIBILITY',\n    'Lady Susan': 'LADY SUSAN'\n}\n\nfor work, content in jane_austen_work.items():\n    if work == 'Pride and Prejudice':\n        start_tag = '***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK {}***'.format(titles[work])\n        end_tag = '***END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK {}***'.format(titles[work])  \n        \n        work_string = content.split(start_tag)[1]\n        work_string = work_string.split(end_tag)[0]\n        work_chapters = [i.lower() for i in work_string.split('CHAPTER')[1:]]        \n    elif work == 'Love and Freindship [sic]':\n        start_tag = '*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK {} ***'.format(titles[work])\n        end_tag = '*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK {} ***'.format(titles[work])\n\n        work_string = content.split(start_tag)[1]\n        work_string = work_string.split(end_tag)[0]\n        work_chapters = [i.lower() for i in work_string.split('LETTER')[1:]]\n    else:\n        start_tag = '*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK {} ***'.format(titles[work])\n        end_tag = '*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK {} ***'.format(titles[work])\n\n        work_string = content.split(start_tag)[1]\n        work_string = work_string.split(end_tag)[0]\n        work_chapters = [i.lower() for i in work_string.split('CHAPTER')[1:]]\n\n    if work == 'Emma':\n        work_chapters = work_chapters[55:]\n    elif work == 'Persuasion':\n        work_chapters = work_chapters[24:]\n    elif work == 'Northanger Abbey':\n        work_chapters = work_chapters[31:]\n    elif work == 'Mansfield Park':\n        work_chapters = work_chapters[48:]\n    elif work == 'Sense and Sensibility':\n        work_chapters = work_chapters[50:]\n    elif work == 'Love and Freindship [sic]':\n        work_chapters = work_chapters[34:]\n\n    chapters[work] = work_chapters\n\nAt this point, I’ve created two important strings: jane_austen_work and chapters. The “jane_austen_work” is a dictionary, for which each tuple represent a key that is a book title and a value that is the content/text of the book. This makes the accessibility of txt files according to book title easy for later analysis. The “chapters” is also a dictionary, for which whenever I enter the key, or a book title, the content/value will be the corresponding txt split into book chapters. This helps me to conduct analysis per chapter and track development in each book.\nNext part is my data visualizations and analysis. For simplicity and detailed analysis, I will be concentrating on three of the most popular works of Jane Austen, which is “Pride and Prejudice”, “Sense and Sensibility”, and “Emma”.\nMy first visualization is about overall sentiment in each book:\n\n# Data visualization 1 --&gt; Overall Sentiment\n\n# Compute the overall polarity score of positive and negative words in each book\n# Combine into one visualization\n\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\nanalyzer = vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# For each book, I find the most frequent positive words and negative words, then put them separately into two lists\n\n# Emma\nemma_string = jane_austen_work['Emma'].lower()\nemma_tokens = word_tokenize(emma_string)\n\nmyStopWords = list(punctuation) + stopwords.words('english')\nnewEmma_list = [s for s in emma_tokens if s.lower() not in myStopWords]\n\npos_list1 = []\nneg_list1 = []\n\nfor word in newEmma_list:\n  score = analyzer.polarity_scores(word)\n  compound_score = score['compound']\n  if compound_score &gt; 0:\n    pos_list1.append(word)\n  elif compound_score &lt; 0:\n    neg_list1.append(word)\n  else:\n    pass\n\ncom_pos1 = nltk.FreqDist(pos_list1).most_common(15)\ncom_neg1 = nltk.FreqDist(neg_list1).most_common(15)\n\npos_words1, pos_frequencies1 = zip(*com_pos1)\nneg_words1, neg_frequencies1 = zip(*com_neg1)\n\n\n# Pride and Prejudice\npj_string = jane_austen_work['Pride and Prejudice'].lower()\npj_tokens = word_tokenize(pj_string)\n\nnewPj_list = [s for s in pj_tokens if s.lower() not in myStopWords]\n\npos_list2 = []\nneg_list2 = []\n\nfor word in newPj_list:\n  score = analyzer.polarity_scores(word)\n  compound_score = score['compound']\n  if compound_score &gt; 0:\n    pos_list2.append(word)\n  elif compound_score &lt; 0:\n    neg_list2.append(word)\n  else:\n    pass\n\ncom_pos2 = nltk.FreqDist(pos_list2).most_common(15)\ncom_neg2 = nltk.FreqDist(neg_list2).most_common(15)\n\npos_words2, pos_frequencies2 = zip(*com_pos2)\nneg_words2, neg_frequencies2 = zip(*com_neg2)\n\n\n# Sense and Sensibility\nss_string = jane_austen_work['Sense and Sensibility'].lower()\nss_tokens = word_tokenize(ss_string)\n\nnewSs_list = [s for s in ss_tokens if s.lower() not in myStopWords]\n\npos_list3 = []\nneg_list3 = []\n\nfor word in newSs_list:\n  score = analyzer.polarity_scores(word)\n  compound_score = score['compound']\n  if compound_score &gt; 0:\n    pos_list3.append(word)\n  elif compound_score &lt; 0:\n    neg_list3.append(word)\n  else:\n    pass\n\ncom_pos3 = nltk.FreqDist(pos_list3).most_common(15)\ncom_neg3 = nltk.FreqDist(neg_list3).most_common(15)\n\npos_words3, pos_frequencies3 = zip(*com_pos3)\nneg_words3, neg_frequencies3 = zip(*com_neg3)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creating a combined visualization using subplot\n\n# Emma\npos_words1, pos_frequencies1 = zip(*com_pos1)\nneg_words1, neg_frequencies1 = zip(*com_neg1)\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\nplt.barh(pos_words1, pos_frequencies1, color='lightblue', label='Positive Words')\nplt.barh(neg_words1, neg_frequencies1, color='lightgrey', label='Negative Words')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency')\nplt.ylabel('Words')\nplt.title('Emma')\n\n# Pride and Prejudice\npos_words2, pos_frequencies2 = zip(*com_pos2)\nneg_words2, neg_frequencies2 = zip(*com_neg2)\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\nplt.barh(pos_words2, pos_frequencies2, color='lightblue', label='Positive Words')\nplt.barh(neg_words2, neg_frequencies2, color='lightgrey', label='Negative Words')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Pride and Prejudice')\n\n# Sense and Sensibility\npos_words3, pos_frequencies3 = zip(*com_pos3)\nneg_words3, neg_frequencies3 = zip(*com_neg3)\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\nplt.barh(pos_words3, pos_frequencies3, color='lightblue', label='Positive Words')\nplt.barh(neg_words3, neg_frequencies3, color='lightgrey', label='Negative Words')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Sense and Sensibility')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Display the combined plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows the frequency of negative and positive word occurences in each book. A pattern is obvious such that Jane Austen’s writings have a very positive choice of diction, since the frequency of positive words are much higher than the negative ones. This reflects that Jane’s writing style is always encouraging, upward-driven, and energetic. One misleading data, however, is visualized in the plot. The word “miss” have very high frequency as a negative word. However, based on my inspection on the original text file, the word is really a neutral word, such that it is not used to refer to something missing, but rather used for character referencing such as “Miss Bennet”. This data point can be misleading and shows certain flaws in NLP when determining the actual meaning of a word.\nNext is my second data visualziation about sentiment development:\n\n\nShow the code\n# Data visualization 2 --&gt; Sentiment Development\n\n# Create sentiment score for each chapter in each book, then combine into one visualization\n\n# Emma\nchapter_sentiment1 = []\nchapter_number1 = []\n\nfor number, scene in enumerate(chapters['Emma'], 1):\n  chapter_words = word_tokenize(scene)\n  chapter_sentiment1_score = 0\n  for word in chapter_words:\n    scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(word)\n    compound_score = scores['compound']\n    if compound_score &gt; 0:\n        chapter_sentiment1_score += 1\n    elif compound_score &lt; 0:\n        chapter_sentiment1_score -= 1\n  chapter_sentiment1.append(chapter_sentiment1_score)\n  chapter_number1.append(number)\n\n# Pride and Prejudice\nchapter_sentiment2 = []\nchapter_number2 = []\n\nfor number, scene in enumerate(chapters['Pride and Prejudice'], 1):\n  chapter_words = word_tokenize(scene)\n  chapter_sentiment2_score = 0\n  for word in chapter_words:\n    scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(word)\n    compound_score = scores['compound']\n    if compound_score &gt; 0:\n        chapter_sentiment2_score += 1\n    elif compound_score &lt; 0:\n        chapter_sentiment2_score -= 1\n  chapter_sentiment2.append(chapter_sentiment2_score)\n  chapter_number2.append(number)\n  \n# Sense and Sensibility\nchapter_sentiment3 = []\nchapter_number3 = []\n\nfor number, scene in enumerate(chapters['Sense and Sensibility'], 1):\n  chapter_words = word_tokenize(scene)\n  chapter_sentiment3_score = 0\n  for word in chapter_words:\n    scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(word)\n    compound_score = scores['compound']\n    if compound_score &gt; 0:\n        chapter_sentiment3_score += 1\n    elif compound_score &lt; 0:\n        chapter_sentiment3_score -= 1\n  chapter_sentiment3.append(chapter_sentiment3_score)\n  chapter_number3.append(number)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create subplots to combine visualizations of three books\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(18, 5), sharey=True)\n\ncolors1 = ['#E5C7FF' if score &lt; 0 else '#FFDCA5' if score &gt; 0 else 'grey' for score in chapter_sentiment1]\ncolors2 = ['#E5C7FF' if score &lt; 0 else '#FFDCA5' if score &gt; 0 else 'grey' for score in chapter_sentiment2]\ncolors3 = ['#E5C7FF' if score &lt; 0 else '#FFDCA5' if score &gt; 0 else 'grey' for score in chapter_sentiment3]\n\naxes[0].bar(chapter_number1, chapter_sentiment1, color = colors1)\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Chapter')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Sentiment')\naxes[0].set_title('Emma')\n\naxes[1].bar(chapter_number2, chapter_sentiment2, color = colors2)\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Chapter')\naxes[1].set_title('Pride and Prejudice')\n\naxes[2].bar(chapter_number3, chapter_sentiment3, color = colors3)\naxes[2].set_xlabel('Chapter')\naxes[2].set_title('Sense and Sensibility')\n\n# Adjust spacing between subplots\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Display the combined plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows the sentiment development as the plot develops for each book. The overt positive sentiment, as there is almost an absence of negative sentiments all three books, serves as strong evidence and confirmation for my conclusion in the previous visualization. Rather than ups and downs of emotions, the writings of Jane Austen are more characterized by circular peaks of extreme positivism. We can see from the graph that there would be spike(s) of positive sentiment around every 20 chapters in a book or at the very end of the book. It is not surprising to always see an upward-driven sentiment towards the end of the book as Jane Austen like to give happy endings.\nMy third visualization is network analysis of characters:\n\n\nShow the code\n# Data Visualization 3 - Character Analysis\n\n# Emma\nedges1 = [\n    ('Emma', 'Harriet'),\n    ('Emma', 'Jane'),\n    ('Emma', 'Mr.Knightley'),\n    ('Emma', 'Mrs.Weston'),\n    ('Jane', 'Frank'),\n    ('Jane', 'Mrs.Weston'),\n    ('Mr.Knightley', 'Harriet'),\n    ('Harriet', 'Mr.Elton'),\n    ('Emma', 'Miss Bates'),\n    ('Miss Bates', 'Jane') \n]\n\n# Create a network graph\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edges_from(edges1)\n\n# Calculate degree centrality for each node (character)\ndegree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)\n\n# Calculate node size based on degree centrality (multiply by a scaling factor for better visualization)\nnode_size = [2000 * degree_centrality[node] for node in G.nodes()]\n\n# Plot the network graph with node sizes according to degree centrality\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='skyblue', node_size=node_size, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')\nplt.title(\"Character Network Analysis of Emma\")\nplt.show()\n\n# Sense and Sensibility\nedges2 = [\n    ('Elizabeth', 'Darcy'),\n    ('Elizabeth', 'Jane'),\n    ('Jane', 'Bingley'),\n    ('Elizabeth', 'Mrs.Bennet'),\n    ('Elizabeth', 'Wickham'),\n    ('Elizabeth', 'Mr.Collins'),\n    ('Mr.Collins', 'Lady Catherine'),\n    ('Lady Catherine', 'Darcy'),\n    ('Charlotte', 'Elizabeth'),\n    ('Charlotte', 'Mr.Collins')\n]\n\n# Create a network graph\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edges_from(edges2)\n\n# Calculate degree centrality for each node (character)\ndegree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)\n\n# Calculate node size based on degree centrality (multiply by a scaling factor for better visualization)\nnode_size = [2000 * degree_centrality[node] for node in G.nodes()]\n\n# Plot the network graph with node sizes according to degree centrality\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='skyblue', node_size=node_size, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')\nplt.title(\"Character Network Analysis of Pride and Prejudice\")\nplt.show()\n\nedges3 = [\n    ('Elinor', 'Marianne'),\n    ('Elinor', 'Willoughby'),\n    ('Willoughby', 'Marianne'),\n    ('Elinor', 'Mrs.Dashwood'),\n    ('Elinor', 'Lucy Steele'),\n    ('Mrs.Dashwood', 'Marianne'),\n    ('Elinor', 'Mrs.Jennings'),\n    ('Mrs.Jennings', 'Marianne'),\n    ('Elinor', 'Mr.Palmer'),\n    ('Marianne', 'Mrs.Ferrars')\n]\n\n# Create a network graph\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edges_from(edges3)\n\n# Calculate degree centrality for each node (character)\ndegree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)\n\n# Calculate node size based on degree centrality (multiply by a scaling factor for better visualization)\nnode_size = [2000 * degree_centrality[node] for node in G.nodes()]\n\n# Plot the network graph with node sizes according to degree centrality\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='skyblue', node_size=node_size, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')\nplt.title(\"Character Network Analysis of Sense and Sensibility\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the character analysis of all three books. These character networks shows that Jane Austen likes to write about female protagonists, and the men and family members revolving around the female protagonist. Austen’s writings always favor the themes of romance, marriage, and family. Through the character analysis, we can see that Austen’s writing style heavily emphasizes familial and friend relationships around the main character, and using these relationships to connect together, oftentimes a close-knit circle of characters and then giving her narrative about society and interpersonal relationships."

    "title": "Jane Austen: a positive critic",
    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nJane Austen was born in the 1770s and grew up in a close-knit family. Love by her brothers, she was supported by her family members to write and publish for an entire lifetime. She was never married, but instead was taken care of by her brothers until death. The protection of family members and absence of marital experience would explain the positivity in Jane’s writings, as her work reflect a sense of genuincy towards romance and faith in the power of love. This is not to say that Jane is only a little girl daydreaming about romance, but rather she expose the reality and often brutal nature of familial life, and subsequently critiquing the society through a reflection of issue in the family, yet still maintaining a positive attitude or faith towards the creation of bonding and maintenance of a family unit. In a way, Jane is uncovering the scars of society with a soft hand.\nJane was also a feminist, such that she particularly likes to write about female protagonists including their growth, thinking, and action. This contrasts with other authors of her time, when writing about women were rare. It can be argued that the frequent publications of Jane was a deliberate act to change public view, or to voice the reality of women’s situation in the family and society through public circulation of her writings. Using a fairly easy reading level of words, then, would also be necessary to enhance accessibility. Despite this effort, history hasn’t been nice to Austen. Her works wasn’t popularized at the time of first publication, even though it attracted female readers, copies of her books were destroyed after her death by her publishers. It would not be until the 19th century that her works obtain recognition and popularity. Even though Jane Austen did not live to see her writings popularized, she left in no doubt a legacy as a female writer with her unique writing style of positive critic and special emphasis on the topics of family and women."
