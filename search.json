    "text": "Introduction\nMy final project datasets include the “classics” dataset from corgis, and various books written by Jane Austen from Project Gutenberg. I am motivated to conduct analysis about Jane Austen because she was one of the greatest female novelists in the 18th century. Her works always express a well-articulated crique and reflection about romance, marriage, wealth, and society, which led me to ask the question: what is the unique writing style or characteristic of Jane Austen? To answer this question, I will be using data from the following sources: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/classics/ https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31100\n\n\nExploring the Data\nThe classics dataset includes data about 1006 books from the work of 555 authors. For each book, the dataset provides general information such as publication year and classification, also word analysis information such as number of sentences or reading difficulty level scores. Some potential flaws in the data are overlapping information and missing/misleading publication year. The book “Pride and Prejudice”, for example, have two versions that is one updated and another older. Publication year may also be misleading as the year may reflect a more recent, edited publication of the book rather than the original publication year. Data cleaning is required before substantive analysis is conducted.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndataset = \"classics.csv\"\n\nclassic_data = pd.read_csv('classics.csv')\nclassic_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbibliography.congress classifications\nbibliography.languages\nbibliography.subjects\nbibliography.title\nbibliography.type\nmetadata.downloads\nmetadata.id\nmetadata.rank\nmetadata.url\nbibliography.author.birth\n...\nmetrics.sentiments.polarity\nmetrics.sentiments.subjectivity\nmetrics.statistics.average letter per word\nmetrics.statistics.average sentence length\nmetrics.statistics.average sentence per word\nmetrics.statistics.characters\nmetrics.statistics.polysyllables\nmetrics.statistics.sentences\nmetrics.statistics.syllables\nmetrics.statistics.words\n\n\n\n\n0\nPR\nen\nSisters -- Fiction,Courtship -- Fiction,Social...\nPride and Prejudice\nText\n36576\n1342\n1\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342\n1775\n...\n0.136713\n0.522239\n4.83\n18\n0.05\n586794\n4603\n6511\n170648.1\n121533\n\n\n1\nPS\nen\nMentally ill women -- Fiction,Feminist fiction...\nThe Yellow Wallpaper\nText\n26363\n1952\n2\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952\n1860\n...\n0.054174\n0.534787\n4.41\n15\n0.06\n26769\n102\n385\n7686.9\n6067\n\n\n2\nPZ,PR\nen\nFantasy\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland\nText\n18882\n11\n3\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11\n1832\n...\n0.041079\n0.497276\n4.65\n17\n0.06\n122719\n339\n1501\n33810.3\n26389\n\n\n3\nPR\nen\nMonsters -- Fiction;Frankenstein's monster (Fi...\nFrankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus\nText\n17128\n84\n4\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84\n1797\n...\n0.100902\n0.539516\n4.77\n23\n0.04\n357604\n2604\n3239\n106802.1\n74959\n\n\n4\nPT\nen\nPsychological fiction,Metamorphosis -- Fiction\nMetamorphosis\nText\n15683\n5200\n5\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5200\n1883\n...\n0.041997\n0.479019\n4.56\n27\n0.04\n100372\n397\n800\n28752.3\n22022\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 38 columns\n\n\n\n\nnum_books = classic_data['bibliography.title'].count()\nprint(num_books)\n\n1006\n\n\n\nnum_authors = classic_data['bibliography.author.name'].nunique()\nprint(num_authors)\n\n555\n\n\n\njane_data = classic_data[classic_data['bibliography.author.name'] == \"Austen, Jane\"]\n\n\n# Data Visualization 1\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nauthor_birth_year = classic_data['bibliography.author.birth']\nfiltered_data = classic_data[author_birth_year.between(1700, 1799)]\nauthor_name = filtered_data['bibliography.author.name']\nreadability_score = filtered_data['metrics.difficulty.flesch reading ease']\n\nplt.bar(author_name, readability_score)\nplt.xlabel(\"Author Name\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Flesch Reading Ease Score\")\nplt.title(\"Reading Difficulty Levels of Classic Literature in 18th Century\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right', fontsize=5)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nComment: Jane Austen’s work has an average flesch reading score of about 70, which is a fairly easy to read level (7th grade material according to official flesch reading ease website).\n\n# Data Visualization 2\n\nbook_title = jane_data['bibliography.title']\ntitle_to_exclude = 'The Complete Project Gutenberg Works of Jane Austen: A Linked Index of all PG Editions of Jane Austen'\nfiltered_book_title = book_title[~(book_title == title_to_exclude)]\nnum_words = jane_data['metrics.statistics.words']\nfiltered_num_words = jane_data.loc[~(book_title == title_to_exclude), 'metrics.statistics.words']\n\nplt.bar(filtered_book_title, filtered_num_words)\nplt.title(\"Total Word Count in Jane Austen's Works\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Book Title\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Words\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nComment: Jane Austen writes both short and long novels.\n\n# Data Visualization 3\n\nnum_words = jane_data['metrics.statistics.words']\nreadability = jane_data['metrics.difficulty.difficult words']\n\nplt.plot(num_words, readability)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Data Visualization 4\n\nauthor_book_count = classic_data.groupby('bibliography.author.name')['bibliography.title'].count()\n\nplt.hist(author_book_count)\nplt.xlabel('Number of Books Written by Author')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Distribution of Book Publication Frequency by Each Author')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nComment: Jane Austen had 8 publications, which is substantially more compared to other classics authors. What are potential factors for this? Her career as a novelist? More talent? Personal life? Time period? Jane was born into a wealthy family and she was sponsored the entire life by her brother to work on literature.\n\n\nAnalysis\nFor my analysis, I plan to webscrape the Project Gutenberg’s complete collection of works by Jane Austen. I would write a function that retrieves each books’ text file from the website, then split each text into string according to chapters. The end result would be 8 strings with eacch string item being one chapter of that particular book.\n\nimport requests\n\ntarget_url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt\"\nresponse = requests.get(target_url)\npp_string = response.text\npp_string = pp_string.split('***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE***')[1]\npp_string = pp_string.split('***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE***')[0]\npp_chapters = [i.lower() for i in pp_string.split('CHAPTER')[1:]]\n\n\nprint(pp_chapters[0])\n\n i.\n\n\nit is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n\nhowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\n\n\"my dear mr. bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\nnetherfield park is let at last?\"\n\nmr. bennet replied that he had not.\n\n\"but it is,\" returned she; \"for mrs. long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.\"\n\nmr. bennet made no answer.\n\n\"do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\n\n\"_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.\"\n\nthis was invitation enough.\n\n\"why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came\ndown on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.\"\n\n\"what is his name?\"\n\n\"bingley.\"\n\n\"is he married or single?\"\n\n\"oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four\nor five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\n\"how so? how can it affect them?\"\n\n\"my dear mr. bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! you\nmust know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\n\"is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\n\"i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.\"\n\n\"my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\ni do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. when a woman has\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\n\"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"it is more than i engage for, i assure you.\"\n\n\"but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\ncomers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\n\"you are over scrupulous surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\ni must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.\"\n\n\"i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as lydia. but you are always giving _her_ the\npreference.\"\n\n\"they have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\n\"mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take\ndelight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\n\"you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they\nare my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\n\"ah! you do not know what i suffer.\"\n\n\"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.\"\n\n\"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them\nall.\"\n\nmr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. she was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented she\nfancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Data visualization 1 --&gt; Overall Sentiment\n\n# Compute the overall polarity score of positive and negative words in each book\n# Combine into one visualization\n\n\n# Data visualization 2 --&gt; Sentiment Development\n\n# Compute development of sentiment in each book\n# Combine into one visualization\n\n\n# Data visualization 3 --&gt; Character Analysis\n\n# Create a graph of character interactions and relationships\n# then use networkx and matplotlib to visualizae the network\n\n\n# Data visualization 4 --&gt; Important Sentences\n\n# Use techniques of automatic bulletting\n# Generate a list of important sentences from each book\n# then visualize using stacked bar chart for what percentage is positive or negative"
